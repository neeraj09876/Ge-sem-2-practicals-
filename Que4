4. Using Titanic dataset, do the following

a. Find total number of passengers with age less than 30

b. Find total fare paid by passengers of first class

c. Compare number of survivors of each passenger class

#ans:
import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
titanic_df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')  # Replace 'titanic.csv' with the actual file path

# a. Find total number of passengers with age less than 30
passengers_under_30 = titanic_df[titanic_df['Age'] < 30]
total_passengers_under_30 = passengers_under_30.shape[0]
print("Total number of passengers with age less than 30:", total_passengers_under_30)

# b. Find total fare paid by passengers of first class
first_class_fares = titanic_df[titanic_df['Pclass'] == 1]['Fare'].sum()
print("Total fare paid by passengers of first class:", first_class_fares)

# c. Compare number of survivors of each passenger class
survivors_by_class = titanic_df.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].sum()
print("Number of survivors of each passenger class:")
print(survivors_by_class)
